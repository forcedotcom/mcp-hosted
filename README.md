# Salesforce Hosted MCP Servers (Beta)

This repository contains public resources, documentation links, and issues related to Salesforce’s Hosted MCP Server capability. It supports our ongoing **Beta** program to validate interoperability, performance, and developer experience for external AI agents connecting securely to Salesforce.

## Overview

Salesforce Hosted MCP Servers allow administrators to expose Salesforce logic and assets to external agents such as Claude, Cursor, or Windsurf to interact with Salesforce resources and automation in a secure, governed manner. This capability is part of our broader effort to make Salesforce the trusted hub for **agentic interoperability**—offering customers and partners a paved, secure path to connect their AI systems without relying on unverified free or third-party solutions.

## Beta Status

This feature is currently in open **Beta**, enabling customers to opt-in to test this feature set before the GA release. Feedback gathered through this repo’s Issues helps us refine configuration, authentication, and runtime behavior before GA.
