# Contribution Guide For Hosted MCP Servers
Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to the Salesforce Hosted MCP Server!

Since our MCP servers are fully hosted, there's no need to worry about the code behind the service itself. At this stage, we're looking for your feedback: issues, use cases, ideas, and more. Before you get started, review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to help us keep our OSS projects a safe and welcoming environment.

## Issues, requests & ideas

Use GitHub Issues page to submit issues, enhancement requests and discuss ideas.

### Bug Reports and Fixes
